# gearbox

Designs for rudimentary home-made gearboxes/transmissions.

I (currently) have no machining experience, skill, or equipment, so the designs
are built around the idea that all of the parts are off the shelf. Hopefully
there will be improved designs over time, perhaps enhanced by improved
machining and fab capabilities.

## [tractor-1.0](/tractor-1.0)

This is my first design. It targets a home-made small tractor and is therefore
built for relatively low speed but high torque. It supports hi/lo with reverse.

The design centers around the use of chain and sprockets wherever possible due
to the extreme cost of gears. There is one set of gears involved, because I
don't know of any other way to reverse the direction of rotation.
