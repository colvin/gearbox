# gearbox

Designs for rudimentary home-made gearboxes/transmissions.

I (currently) have no machining experience, skill, or equipment, so the designs
are built around the idea that all of the parts are off the shelf. Hopefully
there will be improved designs over time, perhaps enhanced by improved
machining and fab capabilities.
